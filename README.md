Arm motors control Interface web page
This repository is about creating a control Interface web page for controlling Arm motor by the angle and base motor movement, and 
mobile view for the interface.
We combined the Arm remote and the base remote in one page to make an easy access
files:
1- index.html >> the body of the interface web page
2- style.css >> the design of the interface web page
3- main.js >> to make the page active, to show the current value of the scroller 'angle'
5- indexmobile.html >> mobile view for the interface web page
6- stylemobile.css >> the design of the mobile view interface web page
7- arm base database.png >> show the databese no.3 that store the base movements history
